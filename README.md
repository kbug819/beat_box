# beat_box
Mod1 Beat Box Project

# Overview
In this project we’re going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically, we’re going to make a very basic drum machine program.

However to add some additional depth, let’s also use this project as a chance to explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science – the Linked List.

# Learning Goals
- Follow an interaction pattern
- Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
- Write tests
- Distinguishing between classes and instances of those classes
- Use and implement iteration or recursion techniques
- Host code on Github
